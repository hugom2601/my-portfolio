			<p>To Whom It May Concern : <br/> <br/>I'm Hugo, currently enrolled in the MSC Digital Marketing and Sales at Kedge Business School, in France. <br/> <br/> Just like a crowd of other students, I need to complete a final internship to obtain my degree. This is the reason why you received my application. But the reason I made all of this (i.e. this small website), is that I want you to have a better insight on who I am. <br/>My goal is to work for something that makes sense to me through a specific kind of Marketing. I consider that it is a powerful tool, and I'm convinced that it needs to be used with discernment and carefulness.<br/><br/>Thus, I would like to use Marketing for things that need, today maybe more than ever, to be promoted; for things that are useful to people and society, without harming too much in return. <br/> Examples of those are, in my opinion : Journalism, Bookselling, Publishing, NGO's, Museums, Sports; and virtually any company or organisation that works for or promotes education, solutions for the climate crisis, fundamental human rights, sports and going outdoors...etc. <br/>Of course there's a lot more, but those are the ones I am the most interested in.<br/><br/>I encourage you to browse through this website, explore it, and you may see it as my personal portfolio.</p>
